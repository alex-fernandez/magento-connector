================== 1.1 ==================

* Cloud Connector SDK integration

 The Connector now uses the CloudConnector SDK for generating the schemas and handlers. However, as a drawback, lists and maps passing to some connector operations in not 
as customizable as before, and there are some possible desirable use-cases that will not be supported by the current version, until those features are supported by the 
cloud connector schema generator. See issue http://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/CLDCONNECT-18

* Generic Create/Update operations

 Creation and update of Magento entities is complex as they involve most times dozens of mandatory and/or optional attributes. In order to decrease development time, ensure
 consistency and simplify such operations, that would otherwise require up to 20 arguments, we have generalized them so that those attributes are passed as simple String-Object Maps. 
 The same applies for return types. Such strategy, when combined with enhancements described in previous sections, will add flexibility to the manner attributes are passed.     

* Filtering Expressions

 Supports all default filtering binary operation - from, to, eq, neq, like, nlike, is, moreq, gt, lt, gteq, lteq, in, nin, finset -, all the default filtering 
unary expressions - null, notnull -, plus custom istrue and isfalse unary expressions. Both custom operation were not originally cover by the development plan, but were
added since it was not a big effort, but simplifies many common filters.  

* Known Issues

 Category creation is not working due to a magento bug - it requires an attribute that is not exposed through the SOAP API. This Issues was apparently fixed
 circa March 2011, but has been not released yet - it was not included in 1.5.0.1 . See http://www.magentocommerce.com/bug-tracking/issue?issue=10637
 and http://www.magentocommerce.com/bug-tracking/issue?issue=11079
 
* Current Store Refactor

 The following operations have been merged into a single one, as all them were just alias of the same one, and were thought to be different because of
a bad understanding of the API:
 * catalog-category-currentStore
 * catalog-category-attribute-currentStore
 * catalog-product-currentStore
 * catalog-product-attribute-currentStore
 * catalog-product-attribute-media-currentStore
 
 On the other side, the currentStore operation works a both a setter or getter of the current session store, depending on how it is used. In order
to be simple, it has been splitted into two operations - updateCurrentStore and getCurrentStore. 
 
* Media Upload

 Unlike most operations, that have been exposed as-is following the original Magento Connector philosophy, some product media upload parameters haven been adapted and exposed
 as connector arguments, in order to simplify input-streams passing and base64 encoding.
 
* Operation Naming

 Both the SOAP API and the original connector exposed operations using an noun-verb / object-method naming convention, using verbs in an inconsistent way.
 The connector now exposes all their operation using a more expressive, english-friendly verb-noun naming, and using verbs in a more consistent way. For example,
 SOAP directoryRegionList API mehtod has been renamed to listDirectoryRegions, and customerCustomerInfo has been renamed as getCustomer.
